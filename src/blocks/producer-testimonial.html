                    <blockquote>"I joined KPBS' Producers Club to support public broadcasting. The educational shows that my children grew up watching, and now my grandchildren, are very important to me. The programming, news and diverse community that KPBS supports is very impactful. Of course, all the classy events I enjoy attending are led by an awesome team that is kind and courteous. I encourage you to join today and make a difference! "
